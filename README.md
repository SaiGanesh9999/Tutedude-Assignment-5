## ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

### Problem Statement
- Create a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.  
- Ask the user to input a student's name.  
- Retrieve and display the corresponding marks.  
- If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

## ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

### Problem Statement
- Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.  
- Extract the first five elements from the list.  
- Reverse these extracted elements.  
- Print both the extracted list and the reversed list.  

### Functionality
- Creates a list `[1, 2, 3, ..., 10]`.  
- Extracts the first five elements â†’ `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.  
- Reverses them â†’ `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.  
- Prints both lists.  

### Example Run
Original first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

### How to Run The Tasks:-
python task1.py
python task2.py
